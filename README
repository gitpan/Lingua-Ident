Description
-----------

This module provides statistical language identification.  For more
details see the POD documentation embedded in the file Ident.pm, or
the Lingua::Ident(3) man page after installation.

Also included is a small utility, trainlid, to build the transition
matrices needed by the Lingua::Ident module.  It has POD documentation
embedded, too.

The data directory contains short sample texts in several languages,
from which transition matrices are built for testing purposes.  These
matrices are inadequate for actual applications; build your own
matrices from samples of at least 50KB size for optimal results.

liddemo is a demo application for Lingua::Ident.  You can run it after
having done "make" and "make test".  It reads 20 bytes of text from
standard input and prints its language.  By default it uses the
example matrices from the data directory.  Remove the "use lib" line
to use an installed version of Lingua::Ident.
